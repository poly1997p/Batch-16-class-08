    <p class="pera">Makeup is something magical not because I use it I say this but makeup will
         help you in so many was like covering that pimple that you hate or maybe 
         to <br>have that nice even tone face that you wished you have. I mean makeup
          can be very expensive but sometimes it is worth all the money paid for the
           specific<br> product. Makeup is something normal people and celebrities use. 
           Some of the question  have are that who was the inventor of makeup and what ingredients
            did<br> the makeup consist of at the times that the person created the makeup? I would also like to know what were
             some techniques that they did in olden<br> times that we probably still use today? I would also like to know that if the
              modern makeup now today still has the same ingredients

                <p>Makeup is an art because you change the image of a person to look completely different from what they look, 
                    you also mix colors to create a beautiful look or as I call it a masterpiece. Makeup has so many looks like natural, everyday looks, 
                    daytime, nighttime, and dramatic looks and so much more. I also know that the majority if celebrities contour and use highlight to look 
                    glowing and perfect in a everyday basis. Makeup is also used to create special effects in movies or even in plays. Makeup is also a way
                     to express yourself differently. Some of the makeup products that I know are primers for eyes and face,
                      concealer for you under eye circles, foundation to even the tone of your skin, eyeshadows, eyebrow fillers, false lashes, mascara, highlight, blush, contour, lip products to pop a color on the lips, and eyeliner and so many more. I’ve heard that celebrities can take up to 3 hour to just do their makeup.
                     I can’t amagine how exzotine it will be to take 3 hour of my day everyday to just do my makeup. </p>
